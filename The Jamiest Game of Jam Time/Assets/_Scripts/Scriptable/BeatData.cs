/*
 what the song data needs to handle (*.beatz format): 
TOD:
* spawning will take into account the note timing (for the first note occurrence per enemy) and an initial buffer time for each enemy (how early the enemy shows up).
* enemies can show up in 3 - 5 preset areas that are identified either in a script or an extra text file.
* notes can show up in predefined areas on the body and should be adjustable by model (can be easily added or removed from a model)
* enemies can either stop the player from moving or can pass by the player and only need to be dodged / hit once
* background objects can also be spawned on a different midi track (most likely an index to a list of objects)
